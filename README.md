AI Disease Prediction System (Ongoing Project):

This project predicts diseases based on user-reported symptoms using a machine learning model. 

What’s done (current state):

1.Collected symptom-disease dataset and cleaned it (removed empty/extra spaces).

2.Encoded symptoms into a one-hot feature matrix.

3.Trained a Random Forest Classifier on the dataset.

4.Built a Streamlit interface where users can select symptoms and get disease predictions.

5.Saved model, label encoder, and feature columns as .pkl files for reuse.

Tools & Technology used:

1.Python, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib

2.Streamlit for UI

3.Git & GitHub for version control

Future Work:

1.Expand dataset with more symptoms and diseases.

2.Add symptom severity and duration to improve accuracy.

3.Integrate with health APIs for real-time monitoring.

4.Deploy a web app for hospitals, clinics, and general users.

5.Experiment with ensemble or deep learning models for better performance.
